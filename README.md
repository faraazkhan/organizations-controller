# Controllers Template Project

The ACK Template Project is a template for starting new projects in the `aws-controller-k8s` Github organization. All controller projects, at minimum, must have the following files:

- a `README.md` outlining the project goals, sponsoring sig, and community contact information
- an `OWNERS` with the project leads listed as approvers ([docs on `OWNERS` files](./OWNERS))
- a `CONTRIBUTING.md` outlining how to contribute to the project
- an unmodified copy of `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` from this repo, which outlines community behavior and the consequences of breaking the code
- a `LICENSE` which must be Apache 2.0 for code projects, without any custom content.
- a `SECURITY.md` which contains steps to take if you discover a potential security issue in this project.

## Community, discussion, contribution, and support

We welcome community contributions and pull requests.
